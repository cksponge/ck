Spring War
-----------
Statements from Riot, Raton, Christine, and office Blake Coalter were read. We then discussed that all parties
should have known that there was a zero tollerance policy. There was no recolection of Jarrod having been 
suspended previously at a kingdom level. There was a statement that was not validated that Jarrod had been
suspended at the park level. All statements agree that Raton struck Riot. The BOD agreed that we should vote
on this not as an indefinate suspension, but to recommend a length of term for the suspension. It was suggested
by Sarah and Ben that Jarrod be given a 2 year suspension and have a zero level tollerance with a permenant
ban if another infraction were to occur. Rob agreed that procedurally we have the option of yeah or neah on 
his ban. 2 (Kenneth and Rob) voted indefinate. 5 (all others) voted neah. We then negotiated that Jarrod should
recieve a 2 year ban and advise future BOD members that any other infrections by Jarrod result in a life 
time ban. Rob then proposed and it was agreed by Barry that Jarrod be banned for 2 years. It uniamously 
passed. Rob will update the circle of monarchs list on esam.

We then talked about Riot. Both Jarrod and Christine testified that Riot acted in an inappropriate manner.
We decided that the manner in which we recieved the complaint would be better presented via certified mail 
instead of via Facebook private message. Ben will reach out with that information.

Rob brought up that Riot had alledgedly been assualted by Chuck Baily previously at the local. Riot gave JD a
statement but never followed up / responded to BOD inquiries about manner and it was shelved.
